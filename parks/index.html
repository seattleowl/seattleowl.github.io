			</ul>

			<h2>Plants</h2>

			<h3>The Tree</h3>
			If you seek climbing this is for you. It is fun at the top, and you get a good view up there. You can shimmy up branches to clime it.

			<h3>Blackberries</h3>
			Watch out! There are a lot of blackberries in the tree part, however they aren't so common in other parts of Pigeon Point. 

			<h3>Terrain</h3>
			The terrain is mostly dry in the fall, though some parts still have lots of plants. In the dry parts there are thorns. It used to be an apple orchard, so there are lots of fruit trees. There are both fields and woods, and people are planting native plants. 

			<h2>Hazards</h2>
			There are many hazards at Pigeon Point, and this is a short list of them to keep you safe. There are good-sized cliffs that end in blackberry fields. When climbing trees, be careful not to fall off them, and make sure to check if the branch can support your weight. There are also giant thistle fields and spiky bushes you can get scrapes from. And there are also coyotes, so don't get close to them.

			<h2>Cautions</h2>
			Here are some cautions to keep the park safe and clean. Please don't litter Please don't trample the plants. People have also planted some baby plants, so be extra careful when around there. And remember this is the home to animals so don't go around chasing them.

			<h2>How to get to Pigeon Point from Youngstown Community Center</h2>
			First go to the Youngstown Community Center parking lot. Then go to the end opposite of Youngstown C.C., and you will see a path. Follow the path and you will reach some stairs. Once you get up, there will be a road. Go past it and you will find more stairs. Climb up the stairs. Go down the path and there will be a road. Go to the other side and go right, and cross the street. Go on the gravel path and turn left when you see the gravel mound, which means you arrived.<br><br>

			<h2>Activities</h2>
			There are so many fun things to do at Long Fellow Dragonfly Creek. It's the perfect place to wade, minus the chemicals from a nearby golf course. The current changes depending on the season, but for the most part is fairly mellow. If swimming is not your speed, grab your friends and play a friendly game of hide and seek, regular, infection, or blob tag in the field. Capture the flag is fun for those hesitant to appear babyish (cough, teenagers, cough). If you want to escape from the city and find a quiet place to write there are some lovely little areas by the creek. Bonus: if you bring binoculars and your observation skills, you'll be golden for bird watching! Picnicking is also fun when it's a nice sunny day at the Dragonfly Park, and after you eat you can run around and play on the field. Long Fellow Creek is also a great place to take pictures because of the interesting terrain, plants, and wildlife, like: indian plum, bumble bees, large ferns, and lots of types of trees and flowers. The trees at Longfellow Creek are perfect for climbing, with a range of difficulty levels. Some trees can challenge even the most seasoned tree climber.<br><br>

			<h2>Plants</h2>

			<h3>Edible Plants</h3>
			At the Dragonfly Pavilion there are some edible plants. Here are some we found: We found Indian Plum which you can eat the leaves of, which taste like bitter cucumber, and you can eat the small plums. We also found blackberries, which you can eat the berries of. There are also a few salmonberry plants with edible berries. There is also stinging nettle which has edible leaves, but be careful, DO NOT TOUCH the bottom of the leaves or the stem because it stings. Some times of the year there are maple flowers too.<br><br>

			<h3>Invasive Plants</h3>
			At the Dragonfly Pavilion there are some invasive plants including ivy, morning glory, blackberry and stinging nettle.<br><br>

			The birds at the Dragonfly Park are these birds: There are robins who have a red belly. There is a woodpecker that is a red-headed woodpecker. There are swallows that have a forked tail and wings that go back. There are crows that are black and say Caw, caw. There are also some songbirds.<br><br>

			Salmon is one of the animals we saw. Salmon are normally shiny. We also saw water skimmers. Water skimmers are little black creatures that float on the water.<br><br>

			<h2>Hazards</h2>
			This is the hazards list for Dragonfly: There is some mud on the hill. The river is cold and mostly runoff from a golf course. On a clear day you can even see a little oil on the surface. There is broken glass, needles, and illegal drug use on occasion in the bushes. Also there are cigarette butts, cigar butts, and lighters. There are a lot of black berries and thorny plants. There is quick sand on the bottom of the creek, and quick mud in the shade. There are steep drops. These are the main hazards at the Dragonfly. Disclaimer: This guide may not recognize all hazards. Use common sense!<br><br>
